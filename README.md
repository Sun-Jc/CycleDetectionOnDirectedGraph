## Fast Incremental Cycle Detection On Directed Graph

- cycle_detect.py: 
    - cycle_detection(edges): yields networkx.DiGraph each time when encounter cycle
        - edges: [(source, target),]
        - time complexity: Õ(m√n)
- test.py:
    - command arg: #nodes #edges

This is an implementation based on this published paper：
